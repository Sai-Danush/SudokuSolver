# SudokuSolver
## Project Overview
A web application that allows users to upload photos of Sudoku puzzles and receive intelligent hints to help solve them. The app uses OCR technology to extract puzzle data from images and provides a smart hint system without spoiling the solving experience.

## Core Features
- Photo upload with automatic grid detection
- OCR-based number extraction from puzzle images
- Interactive digital Sudoku grid
- 3-level smart hint system
- Mistake detection and conflict highlighting
- Error correction interface for OCR inaccuracies

## Development Phases

### Phase 1: Core Sudoku Engine
**Objective:** Build the foundation Sudoku solving logic and hint system

**Deliverables:**
- Interactive 9x9 Sudoku grid UI
- Constraint satisfaction solver algorithm
- 3-level hint generation system:
 - Level 1: General area hints ("There's a move in row 5")
 - Level 2: Technique hints ("Look for naked single in box 7")
 - Level 3: Specific hints ("Cell R5C3 can only be 7")
- Basic validation and conflict detection
- Manual number input interface

**Output:** Working Sudoku helper with manual input capability

### Phase 2: Photo Processing Pipeline
**Objective:** Implement photo-to-grid conversion functionality

**Deliverables:**
- Image upload interface (drag & drop + file picker)
- Tesseract.js OCR integration
- Grid boundary detection algorithms
- Individual cell number extraction
- Image preprocessing for better OCR accuracy

**Output:** System can convert Sudoku photos to digital grids

### Phase 3: User Experience & Correction
**Objective:** Create seamless user workflow and handle OCR errors

**Deliverables:**
- Intuitive error correction interface
- Smooth photo → grid → hints user flow
- Mobile-responsive design
- Session-based progress tracking
- User-friendly hint display system

**Output:** Complete, user-friendly solving experience

### Phase 4: Deployment & Polish
**Objective:** Production-ready application with optimization

**Deliverables:**
- Performance optimization for image processing
- Cross-browser compatibility testing
- Production deployment setup
- Comprehensive error handling
- Edge case management (poor image quality, unusual fonts, etc.)

**Output:** Live, production-ready web application

## Technical Stack
- **Frontend:** HTML5, CSS3, JavaScript (Vanilla or React)
- **OCR:** Tesseract.js (client-side processing)
- **Image Processing:** Canvas API + OpenCV.js (if needed)
- **Hosting:** Netlify/Vercel (free tier)
- **Cost:** $0-5/month for basic hosting

## Success Criteria
- Accurately detects 80%+ of clearly photographed puzzles
- Provides helpful hints without revealing solutions
- Loads and processes images within 10 seconds
- Works on both desktop and mobile browsers
- Intuitive enough for non-technical users

## Development Notes
- Start with Phase 1 to validate core logic before image processing
- Each phase builds incrementally on the previous
- Can deploy after any phase for testing and feedback
- OCR accuracy will require iteration and testing with real puzzle images
